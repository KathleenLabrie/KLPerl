- Add command line arguments checks (eg. recognized options)
- Combine shouldn't be limited to minmax or at least it should refuse
  anything but minmax.  Currently, it accepts anything but does minmax
  anyway.
- imstatistics/imstatsel don't do 'mode' correctly.  I don't know why
  and I don't know what it actually calculates.
- Test 'imslice'
- In imstatsel: doesn't work with '*.fits[section]'; Unix won't expand
  the file names.  Do the expansion within program.

  Selection is weird.  Rewriting might be useful.

  Text 'imstatsel' with typical commands for dark stats.  Simple selection
  commands don't work.
- Write docs.

- Complete imcopy and rotate.
- Consider moving thumbnail to another package
